Whether the pressure is pinned or not, the velocity profile is identical. That's a plus.

However, the profiles are different depending on whether the pressure is integrated by parts or not.

So the oscillations are not caused by the convective term in the NS momentum equation. It's definitely caused by the radial boundary condition at the axis of symmetry.
