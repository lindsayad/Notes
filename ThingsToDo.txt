Things to do critical for immediate work (roughly in order of importance):

- Prepare CV to send to Katy Huff
1) Read over Zapdos chapter and then send to Graves and Gilligan
2) Read and add to intro chapter so that can be sent to everyone on the committee

Things to do in the ongoing quest for open source (not necessarily in order of importance) that are not necessarily critical to my immediate work:

1) Move from iPhone to cyanogen_mod
2) Figure out whether I can have dedicated servers at my residence
2a) Build my dedicated servers
2b) Move from github to gitlab on my own servers
3) Figure out ssh keys for github
4) Figure out how to do everything in sympy better than or equal to what I can do in Mathematica
