ENDF is a format for evaluated cross section data. ACE stands for A Compact
ENDF.

Here's a really great summary of NJOY which is a code that takes nuclear data in
ENDF format and translates it into forms (like ACE I believe) useful for applications like particle
transport codes, etc.

```
The NJOY Nuclear Data Processing System is used to convert evaluated nuclear
data in ENDF format into forms useful for applications. As a bridge between
physics and engineering, it is best used by people with some knowledge of things
like nuclear reaction theory, resonance theory, or scattering theory on one
side, and some knowledge of things like particle transport codes, reactor core
calculations, or radiation medicine on the other. In this short course, we will
introduce you to the NJOY system, give you a quick outline of the physics of
nuclear data, and show you how some of the main applications in nuclear
technology link to NJOY results.
